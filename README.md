# Winterspring Launcher
Allows you to play on [sanctuarywow.com](https://sanctuarywow.com/) with modern 1.14 WoW Client!  
_This is not an official project from the sanctuarywow team._  
_Do not ask the sanctuarywow team for support_  
_(you can still ask in [#addons-and-ui](https://discord.com/channels/973529971740008448/983067524797177996) on Discord)_ 

## Easy setup
The launcher will do everything for you.  
It will download the 1.14 client, setup HermesProxy and launch the game.  
When HermesProxy has an update it is automatically applied.

### Windows <img src="https://blu.wtf/icon_windows.png" alt="windows" width="24" height="24">
1. **Download [the latest .exe release](https://github.com/mastrjj/WinterspringLauncher/releases/tag/Releases**
2. Place it in a separate directory (On first launch it will create subfolders and a desktop icon)
3. Run it
4. **Enjoy your stay on sanctuarywow**


## Addons
Most addons for 1.14.0 should work.  
You can download older versions from CurseForge under the "Files" tab. ([Example](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/questie/files/all?filter-game-version=2020709689%3A9094))  
Here are some working recommendations: 
### Questing
- [[dl](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/questie/download/3519759)] [Questie](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/questie) <- Must have. Even in combination with other addons.
- [[dl](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/guidelime/download/4026001)] [Guidelime (base)](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/guidelime)
- [[dl](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/guidelime_sage/download/3810259)] [Guidelime: Sage Guide](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/guidelime_sage) (Alliance)

### Interface
- [[dl](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/modern-targetframe/download/4024275)] [ModernTargetFrame](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/modern-targetframe) (To see the HP of mobs)
- [[dl](https://github.com/tukui-org/ElvUI/archive/refs/tags/v1.48-classic.zip)] [ElvUI](https://github.com/tukui-org/ElvUI/releases/tag/v1.48-classic) (slightly older working version)

(Feel free to give me new recommendations to extend the list)

## Why?
The modern WoW-Classic client provides many improvements in hardware compatibility and accessibility.
   
The launcher will make the classic client accessible to everyone.  

## Is this allowed?
Currently HermesProxy is tolerated on sanctuarywow.  
⚠️You **will** get suspended if you exploit any game breaking bugs.  
So far no-one has been banned for using official HermesProxy.  
Just use common sense and <u>**play fair**</u>!

# Many thanks to
- [HermesProxy](https://github.com/WowLegacyCore/HermesProxy) to translate legacy traffic to modern one
- [Arctium WoW-Launcher](https://github.com/Arctium/WoW-Launcher) to patch client for custom server connections
